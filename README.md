# PKI Management

![pki](https://circleci.com/gh/PBarri/pki.svg?style=shield)

This repository aims to provide a simple way to bootstrap and manage a PKI infrastructure locally.

The purpose of the library is not to provide an enterprise management tool, but a testing one that is able to avoid all the burden of managing a PKI in scenarios like RabbitMQ testing.

Please note that you must have OpenSSL installed in your computer prior to use this tool. This requirement will be enforced on installation in later versions.

Under development !
