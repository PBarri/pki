# PKI Management

This repository aims to provide a simple way to bootstrap and manage a PKI infrastructure locally.

The purpose of the library is not to provide an enterprise management tool, but a testing one that is able to avoid all the burden of managing a PKI in scenarios like RabbitMQ testing.

Under development !
